# Percolation ðŸ’§ ðŸ§Š

## The Problem
In recent years, percolation theory, the mathematical study of percolation, has provided new insights and techniques into studying the broad range of the natural sciences.  Percolation in these terms, typically refers to movement and flow - usually of filtering fluids through porous materials.  Interestingly, by modelling a percolation system, we are able to solve various problems such as: determining what fraction of a material needs to be metallic so a composite system is an electrical conductor, or under what conditions water will be able to filter through from the top to bottom of a porous landscape with water on the surface and oil below.  In these scientific problems, researchers have been interested in determining whether a system percolates.  Mathematical solutions for determining this threshold number is yet to be derived so the goal is to write a program that is able to estimate the value of the percolation threshold through using statistic measures and visual models.

**Figure 1:**  _To visualize the percolation model above, we can imagine each square constructing the system to be a site.  Each site is uniformly at random being chosen to be open and if there leads a path where the open top site is connected to one of the open bottom sites, then the system can be determined as a system that percolates_
